Before (bloated):  1.3 GB   (image: go-app-bloated)
After  (optimized): 13.7 MB  (image: go-app-optimized)

Base images:
 - Builder: golang:1.22-alpine  (temporary build stage)
 - Runtime: gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot  (ultra-minimal, no shell, non-root by default)

Optimizations applied:
 - Multi-stage build (builder + runtime)
 - Static binary build (CGO_ENABLED=0, -ldflags "-s -w", -trimpath)
 - Minimal runtime layer (distroless)
 - Runs as non-root user
 - Expose correct port 8080

Result:
 - Size reduced from ~1300 MB → 13.7 MB
 - Same API functionality preserved
 - Secure, production-ready image
